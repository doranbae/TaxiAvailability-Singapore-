#Taxi-Availability in Singapore

####Background
Last August, I was in Singapore with my husband on a four-day trip. On the second day, we visited Orchard Road, the holy grail of shopping all the luxury brands and amazying restaurants. After lunch, as we were supposed to meet up with a realtor, we decided to take a cab to the meeting point.

As it turned out, hailing for a cab was the hardest thing in Singapore. My husband stepped off the sidewalk and stuck his arm out and waved at empty cabs, but no one stoped for us. After 15 minutes, a kind driver told us that cabs cannot pull over the sidewalk, and instructed us to go to a proper taxi station. 

Little confused, but we followed his instruction. We walked 5 minutes to a taxi station and found 50 people in line waiting for a cab. 
Well, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. So we waited in line for an hour. AN HOUR for a cab.
